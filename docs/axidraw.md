## Using V3/A2

Y carriage travel is 432 mm = about 17.01 inches
X carriage travel is 595 mm = about 23.42 inches


A2 paper is 420 x 594 mm = 16.54 x 23.39 inches

Strathmore has a bristol series that is 483 x 610 mm = 19 x 24 inches - a little bigger than the A2 paper size. One way to deal with this is to set the origin of the plotter slightly offset from the corner of the paper, and accept this offset as the minimum border size.

The Y offset should be (483 - 432) / 2 = 25.5 mm = 1.0 inches
The X offset should be (610 - 595) / 2 = 7.5 mm = 0.295 inches
